          <p>Silence rarely means that things are going well.
               It's more likely that people are holding back,
                fearing that their honesty will have them on the wrong side of their boss. Some leaders even choose to play nice and stay silent
               to avoid difficult conversations with their people.</p>

            You're a marshmallow. ...
            Don't overlook life's small joys while searching for the big ones. ...
            Last night I dreamt I ate a ten pound marshmallow. ...

          <p>Creative captions offer the ability to have all performances captioned, thereby not
             limiting a deaf or hard of hearing audience to specific dates.
             Additionally, creative captions are a way of adding a visual element to a show through text, images,
             video and animations that can be integral to the design.</p>
